# IO-ECN753

This repository is for ECN753 Industrial Organization exercises.

It is intended to hold all people/group scripts and all project files together in clear separation of people/groups by names of participants. File named "X and Y" contains the files of the group of X and Y individuals, and "Z" contains the files of individual Z only.

The aim in having such a collective repo is to be able to access each other's codes and logic flow to be able to utilize in oneself's own codes to resolve issues and improve efficiency.
