# IO-ECN753

This repository is for ECN753 Industrial Organization exercises.

It is intended to hold all people/group scripts and all project files together in clear separation of people/groups by names of participants. File named "X and Y" contains the files of the group of X and Y individuals, and "Z" contains the files of individual Z only.

The aim in having such a collective repo is to be able to access each other's codes and logic flow to be able to utilize in oneself's own codes to resolve issues and improve efficiency.

## Usage

To get started, navigate to the directory, create and activate the environment with

```console
$ conda env create -f environment_io.yml
$ conda activate environment_io.yml
```

### Important details

The project produces the tables and graphs itself automatically.
The project discussions for some questions are in a separate PDF file.
The python code run on VSCode sometimes gets stuck, so please run the library part first, and the rest bit by bit as well if it gets stuck. (couldnt figure out if it is my Mac's problem or an issue with VSCode or else.)
